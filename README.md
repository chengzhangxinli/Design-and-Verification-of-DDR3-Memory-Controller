# Design-and-Verification-of-DDR3-Memory-Controller
The memory model was leveraged from micron. 
The DDR3 memory controller follows all the timing specification required for the memory model to perform read write operations.
It aso includes read and write buffers to implement the exact functionality of Double data Rate memory.
The testbench has been created using the verification environment and class based implementation.
